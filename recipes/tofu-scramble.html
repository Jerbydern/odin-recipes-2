        <li>Heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Mash the block of tofu right in the pan, with a potato masher or a fork. You can also crumble it into the pan with your hands. Cook, stirring frequently, for 3-4 minutes until the water from the tofu is mostly gone.</li>
        <li>Now add the nutritional yeast, salt, turmeric and garlic powder. Cook and stir constantly for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the non-dairy milk into the pan, and stir to mix. Serve immediately with sliced avocado, hot sauce, parsley, steamed kale, toast or any other breakfast item.</li>
