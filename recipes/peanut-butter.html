    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade peanut butter from <a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/homemade-peanut-butter-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">loveandlemons.com</a> without any of those preservatives they put in the peanut butter you buy at the store.</p>
    <p>Perfect for any recipes requiring peanut butter!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups dry roasted & salted or unsalted peanuts</li>
        <li>Sea salt, to taste (if using unsalted peanuts)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the peanuts in a medium food processor. Process until very smooth, stopping every 30 seconds to 1 minute to scape down the sides of the bowl, as necessary, and to give the food processor's motor a break. The mixture will be chunky at first. Then, it'll thicken into a ball, and finally, it will become creamy and smooth. The whole process should take about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>That's it!</li>
    </ol>
